    <h1 style="color:antiquewhite">The Unintentional Exposé: How AI Reveals Truths About North American Law and Politics</h1><br>
    <h2>By: Kylie Joy Morgan</h2>

       <p style="color:antiquewhite">In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), unexpected revelations and flaws within the systems and structures of our society are continously emerging. One of the most intriguing and perhaps unsettling discoveries has been AI's unintentional exposé of North American laws, and the lack such of regarding regulation and usage of this very advanced tool.<br>
         Through the expolitation of AI from bad actors, it has been illuminated aspects of these systems that were previously hidden or obscured, has now revealed the dangers of AI usage, and the lack of regulation in public use. <br>
         This article explores the ways in which AI has shed light on North American law and politics, revealing both strengths and weaknesses, and the implications of these revelations for the future.<br>
          
         <br><br><b>Artificial Intelligences Increasing Prominence</b>
        
        <br>The pervasive influence of AI is unmistakable, with its impact felt by nearly every individual in today's interconnected world. <br>From the predictive algorithms that power our social media feeds and the automated systems that determine our credit scores, to the questions we ask Chat GPT when our codes not working(speaking from personal experience). AI has seamlessly integrated itself into the fabric of our daily lives. <br> As American Computer Scientist, Fei-Fei Li has observed, "AI is everywhere. It's not that big scary thing in the future. AI is here with us, and will only become more advanced". This integration is set to deepen further as advancements in AI technology continue to evolve at a rapid pace, promising both unprecedented opportunities and unforeseen challenges.
        
       
        <br><br><b>Unearthing the Broken Law System</b><br>
        
        Artificial intelligence, with its ability to process vast amounts of data and identify correlations, has found significant application in endless sectors. Some positive, such extensive medical field advancements, benefitting millions and saving lives daily. Others, influenced negatively such as the uprising trend of Deepfake technology. Once a novelty, has now become a potent tool for spreading misinformation and manipulating public perception. Also notably, Cybercriminals leverage AI algorithms to orchestrate sophisticated attacks that exploit weaknesses in digital systems, leading to data breaches and financial losses on an unprecedented scale.<br> 
        <br>Almost the entirety of the human population is being affected by AI currently. Furthermore, the amount of which we are impacted in our day to day lives is impendingly increasing, and thus, so will the negative influences. <br> 
        The rising trend of these negative by prouducts of AI is spreading like wildfire without the counteractive measures that are nessasary to regulate usage of such tools. It is important to note the negative implications fall upon our hands. As stated by Technical Director of Allen Institute for Artificial Intellgence, Oren Etzioni, "AI is neither good nor evil. It's a tool. It's a technology for us to choose how to use it."<br> The reason for the lack of regulation that allows these poor moraled individuals to continue their work? The flawed North American Law systems.
        
        <br><br><b>The Regulatory Void</b>
        
        <br>The question that arises is why the regulation of AI and its applications has lagged behind its rapid development. As stated, a key factor lies in the inherent flaws of North American law systems, which have struggled to keep pace with the ever-evolving landscape of technology.<br>  Expertly put by Egyptian Scientist Rana el Kaliouby, "The real problem is not the exsiustential threat of Ai. Instead, it is in the devlopment and ethical regulation of AI systems." The decentralized nature of legislative bodies, coupled with the complexity of AI systems, has created a regulatory void that allows for the exploitation of AI's capabilities without adequate safeguards in place.
        
        <br>
        <br><br><b>Absence in the Face of Adversity</b>
        
        <br>The absence of proactive regulation not only exposes individuals and organizations to risks, but also hampers the responsible development and deployment of AI technologies. Without clear guidelines and oversight, the potential for misuse and abuse of AI grows unchecked, leading to an increasing list of societal and ethical dilemmas. <br> The time is now for policymakers and regulatory bodies to come together to establish comprehensive frameworks that balance innovation with accountability.
      
        <br><br><b>Policymakers Need to Hit the Books</b>
        
        <br>The underlying issue in the lack of regulatory measures lies on the notion the figures in charge of executing these regulations, are ill informed of the impacts and dangers of AI. <br>
        There is a pressing need for greater education and awareness surrounding AI technologies worldwide. As individuals become more informed about the capabilities and limitations of AI, they are better equipped to navigate the digital landscape responsibly. This includes understanding the risks associated with sharing personal data, recognizing the signs of AI-driven scams, and advocating for transparent AI systems that prioritize user privacy and safety.
        
        <br>As AI continues to evolve and permeate all aspects of society, from law enforcement to political campaigns, ethical governance frameworks become paramount. North American policymakers are faced with the task of developing regulations that ensure AI systems are used responsibly and accountably.
        
        <br>Ethical AI governance should encompass principles of transparency, fairness, and accountability. This includes mechanisms for auditing algorithms, addressing bias, and ensuring that AI serves the public good rather than perpetuating harm.
        
        <br><br> <b>Conclusion: Reimagining Laws for the Digital Age</b>
        
        <br>In conclusion, the dual nature of artificial intelligence presents a groundbreaking challenge as we navigate the uncharted waters of technological advancement. While the positive contributions of AI hold immense promise for improving lives and driving innovation, the negative impacts underscore the urgent need for responsible regulation and ethical considerations. The burden falls on policymakers, technologists, and society as a whole to collaborate in shaping a future where AI serves as a force for good, while safeguarding against its potential harms.
